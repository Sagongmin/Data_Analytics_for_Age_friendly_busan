# Decison Location of Senior Center on Data Analytics for Age-friendly Busan
Selection of Optimal Location for the Elderly-Friendly City Based on Data

## summary
The International Health Organization WHO has proposed eight interconnected domains within the [Age-Friendly World] (https://extranet.who.int/agefriendlyworld/age-friendly-cities-framework/) framework). 
Domains can help identify and refer to boundaries for participation and health in older adults. 
We seek to improve the transparency and policy quality of policies related to the aging-friendly city of Busan by proposing an open data-based location intelligence framework. 
The policy direction of Busan, an aging-friendly city, consists of five strategies, 20 tasks, and 110 detailed projects Related Links (http://afc.bswdi.re.kr/Main.do). 
Our goal is to develop an open source-based analysis framework that can be reused and reproduced by creating an analysis case with open data for policies that will be in progress/implemented.

## about present
The current framework uses Open Source Geographic Information Services (GIS) tools to support senior center location analysis. 
1. Data analysis process for location optimization (accessibility (walking time), utilization per senior citizen, change in elderly population)
2. Borrow real estate theory to establish the optimal location mathematical model for each elderly person.

## about future
Our goal is not to use a commercial framework, but to enhance and develop an open source-based analysis framework and to develop an analysis case.
1. Add factors to consider for location analysis
2. Data are currently aggregated by the intersection of the road network. Applying statistical methods/machine learning/deep learning/graph methodology to aggregate data
3. Implement various visual maps and charts for location analysis.
4. Add data on convenience facilities for location analysis (free cafeteria, general hospital, pharmacy)

## feature

## Technical requirements
- code simplification
- method of quantified according to real estate, altitude, and travel distance 
  - ex) Travel time (y) = A travel distance (x) + B (A, B : real estate, altitude)
- Advancement of population prediction
- Annotation required
